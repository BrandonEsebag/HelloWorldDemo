# HelloWorldDemo
I was asked to create this to learn how to use GitHub

using System;

namespace HelloWorldGithubTest
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //This is the code demo requested for Matthew. The code was generated when I made the project, but I am pretty sure the main goal of this exersize was to learn how to use GitHub, so i will try to upload this.
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
